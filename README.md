## Description

_Each turn, a player rolls a die repeatedly until a 1 is rolled or the player holds, where the sum of the round's points are added to their game total. If the player rolls a 1, the player earns no points this round, and loses their turn. If the player rolls any other number, the sum is added to their current round points, and can roll again. If the player chooses instead to hold, the current round points is added to their game total. First player to 100 points wins._
