PIG DICE:
-----------------------
Two player game.

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled, or the player decides to hold.

if player rolls a 2,3,4,5,6 
-- the number gets added to their score. The player can choose to roll again.

if player rolls a 1 
-- they score nothing, and their turn ends.

if a player chooses to hold, 
their turn total is added to the score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

First player to score 100 wins.
